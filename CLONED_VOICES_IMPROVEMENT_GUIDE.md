# Guide to Improving Cloned Voice Quality

## Why Cloned Voices May Sound Robotic or with Wrong Accent

1. **Reference Audio Quality**: The quality of your reference audio significantly affects the cloned voice quality.

2. **Model Limitations**: Current voice cloning models have inherent limitations in perfectly reproducing all voice characteristics.

3. **Language Mismatch**: The model may be trained primarily on one variant of a language (e.g., Brazilian Portuguese) and struggle with others (e.g., European Portuguese).

## Tips for Better Cloned Voices

### 1. Reference Audio Requirements

- **Format**: WAV or high-quality MP3 (44.1kHz or 48kHz)
- **Duration**: Minimum 10 seconds, ideally 30-60 seconds
- **Quality**: Clear speech with minimal background noise
- **Content**: Varied speech with different phonemes and intonations
- **Speaker**: Single speaker only

### 2. Recording Tips

- Record in a quiet environment
- Use a decent microphone (built-in laptop mic can work)
- Speak naturally at a consistent volume
- Avoid background music or noise
- Record multiple samples if possible

### 3. Language Considerations

- Our system uses models primarily trained on **Brazilian Portuguese**
- European Portuguese accents may not reproduce perfectly
- For best results, use reference audio in the same variant as the training data

### 4. Model Selection

The system automatically tries these models in order:
1. **YourTTS** - Best for voice cloning (multilingual)
2. **Portuguese VITS** - Good for Portuguese
3. **Tacotron2** - Alternative Portuguese model

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Voice sounds robotic
**Solution**: 
- Use longer reference audio (30+ seconds)
- Ensure clear pronunciation in reference
- Try different reference samples

### Issue: Wrong accent (Portugal vs Brazil)
**Solution**:
- The model is trained primarily on Brazilian Portuguese
- European Portuguese may sound different
- Try using a reference audio with the desired accent

### Issue: Voice doesn't sound like reference
**Solution**:
- Check reference audio quality
- Ensure single speaker in reference
- Try a different reference sample

## Best Practices

1. **Upload high-quality reference audio**
2. **Use descriptive voice names**
3. **Test with short phrases first**
4. **Experiment with different reference samples**
5. **Be patient - voice cloning is still an emerging technology**

## Technical Notes

- Voice cloning uses speaker embedding technology
- The YourTTS model is the most capable for cloning
- Perfect reproduction is not guaranteed due to model limitations
- Future updates may improve quality

## For Developers

To further improve voice cloning:

1. **Implement proper speaker embedding loading**
2. **Add fine-tuning capabilities**
3. **Include preprocessing for reference audio**
4. **Add quality metrics for cloned voices**
5. **Implement multi-reference averaging**

The current implementation provides a solid foundation that can be enhanced with additional machine learning techniques.
